## About drone_db

drone_db is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. drone_db takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://drone_db.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://drone_db.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://drone_db.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://drone_db.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://drone_db.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://drone_db.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://drone_db.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://drone_db.com/docs/broadcasting).

drone_db is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
